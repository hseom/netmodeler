Netmodelet now uses the autoconf and automake build system.

You should be able to run ./configure && make to compile all the code and the
test program netmodeler.  After that, you are on your own!

To rebuild some of the make files you may need to run bootstrap.sh
(or the programs in that shell in that order).

The above should make the netmodlib.a library and the netmodeler executable from
the main.cpp in the main library.  This main.cpp probably is not exactly what
you want.  Check the examples directory for simpler examples.

To write your own code you just use any parts you would like, then using the
compiler, link to the netmodlib.a.  For g++ (the GNU C++ compiler), you could
do the following:

First compile your my.cpp:
g++ -c my.cpp -I /path/to/headers/
Then link it:
g++ -o test my.o /path/to/library/netmodlib.a

now, the executible "test" should be your code.

You may need to give a complete path to the headers (which is represented in
the above example as /path/to/headers/) and you may need to give the complete
path to the netmodlib.a file (which is represented above as
/path/to/library/).

Good Luck,
