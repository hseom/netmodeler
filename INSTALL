There is no "installing" netmodeler as of yet.  Perhaps someone will
make a shared library build of libnetmod, and we will all celebrate,
but in the mean time, it is all static builds all from the build
directory.

To write your own code you just use any parts you would like, then using the
compiler, link to the netmodlib.a.  For g++ (the GNU C++ compiler), you could
do the following:

First compile your my.cpp:
g++ -c my.cpp -I /path/to/headers/
Then link it:
g++ -o test my.o /path/to/library/libnetmod.a

now, the executible "test" should be your code.

You may need to give a complete path to the headers (which is represented in
the above example as /path/to/headers/) and you may need to give the complete
path to the netmodlib.a file (which is represented above as
/path/to/library/).
